Patient-Reported Outcomes in Older Adults With Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy - JACC
  https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacadv.2025.102204
    - Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have gained increasing attention as key endpoints in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) studies and heart failure trials, providing a holistic evaluation of treatment impact.
    - A recent analysis found that EQ-5D-5 L and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire were predictors of all-cause mortality in ATTR-CM patients, demonstrating the importance of PROs in assessing disease burden.
    - Composite endpoints or "win" ratio approaches incorporating functional endpoints like 6-minute walk distance and PRO measures are increasingly favored in ATTR-CM trials to capture treatment effects beyond traditional cardiovascular outcomes.

Patient-Reported Symptom Assessment and Early Chemotherapy Discontinuation in ... - medRxiv

    - More frequent completion of patient-reported symptom assessments post CTX initiation is associated with a lower risk of early discontinuation in gastrointestinal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.
    - After adjusting for demographic, clinical covariates, and time-varying bias, completing post-initiation assessments was linked to improved outcomes by lowering the cumulative risk of early discontinuation due to toxicity within 90 days.
    - The findings suggest that regular symptom monitoring could be a practical strategy in standard care settings to reduce chemotherapy discontinuation rates and potentially improve patient outcomes.

Strong Correlation of PROMIS Upper Extremity and Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart Score to ...

    - PROMIS UE and SAS scores demonstrate strong correlations with the legacy ASES score in assessing patient-reported outcomes following shoulder arthroplasty, suggesting their effectiveness as alternatives for evaluating upper extremity function.
    - Both PROMIS UE and SAS show excellent-good correlations with ASES at various follow-up points (6 months, 1 year, and minimum 2 years), indicating their sensitivity and utility across different time frames post-surgery.
    - Ceiling effect analysis reveals minimal limitations in the range of scores achieved by patients on both PROMIS UE and SAS, highlighting their capability to capture a broad spectrum of functional outcomes effectively.
