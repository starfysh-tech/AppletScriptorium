  <ul>
<li>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have gained increasing attention as key endpoints in transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) studies and heart failure trials, providing a holistic evaluation of treatment impact.</li>
<li>A recent analysis found that EQ-5D-5 L and Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire were predictors of all-cause mortality in ATTR-CM patients, demonstrating the importance of PROs in assessing disease burden.</li>
<li>Composite endpoints or &quot;win&quot; ratio approaches incorporating functional endpoints like 6-minute walk distance and PRO measures are increasingly favored in ATTR-CM trials to capture treatment effects beyond traditional cardiovascular outcomes.</li>

  <ul>
<li>More frequent completion of patient-reported symptom assessments post CTX initiation is associated with a lower risk of early discontinuation in gastrointestinal cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</li>
<li>After adjusting for demographic, clinical covariates, and time-varying bias, completing post-initiation assessments was linked to improved outcomes by lowering the cumulative risk of early discontinuation due to toxicity within 90 days.</li>
<li>The findings suggest that regular symptom monitoring could be a practical strategy in standard care settings to reduce chemotherapy discontinuation rates and potentially improve patient outcomes.</li>

  <ul>
<li>PROMIS UE and SAS scores demonstrate strong correlations with the legacy ASES score in assessing patient-reported outcomes following shoulder arthroplasty, suggesting their effectiveness as alternatives for evaluating upper extremity function.</li>
<li>Both PROMIS UE and SAS show excellent-good correlations with ASES at various follow-up points (6 months, 1 year, and minimum 2 years), indicating their sensitivity and utility across different time frames post-surgery.</li>
<li>Ceiling effect analysis reveals minimal limitations in the range of scores achieved by patients on both PROMIS UE and SAS, highlighting their capability to capture a broad spectrum of functional outcomes effectively.</li>
