### BACKGROUND CONTEXT
Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is a widely performed spinal decompression procedure used to treat conditions such as disc herniations, degenerative disc disease, and spondylosis. While ACDF is generally effective, the influence of body mass index (BMI) on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including pain relief, functional recovery, and quality of life, remains inadequately explored. Understanding how BMI affects these postoperative measures is essential for optimizing patient counseling, surgical planning, and recovery expectations.
### PURPOSE
To assess the impact of BMI on postoperative pain relief, complication rates, sagittal alignment, and patient-reported outcomes following ACDF.
### STUDY DESIGN/SETTING
Retrospective cohort study at a single institution from 2020 to 2022.
### PATIENT SAMPLE
A total of 302 patients who underwent ACDF were included. Patients were divided into two groups: those with BMI <35 (n=248) and those with BMI ≥35 (n=54). Exclusion criteria included patients undergoing concurrent corpectomy or posterior fusion, as well as those receiving surgery for trauma, tumors, or infections.
### OUTCOME MEASURES
Reoperation rates, complication rates, and perioperative metrics were recorded. Cervical sagittal alignment parameters, including the C2-C7 Cobb angle, sagittal vertical axis (SVA), and T1 slope, were measured preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and on final follow up. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) included the visual analog scale (VAS), brief resilience scale (BRS), good mental health (GMH) scale, and others.
### METHODS
Cervical sagittal alignment parameters and subsidence were measured using lateral radiographs taken preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and at the final follow-up. Pain relief and other PROMs were assessed preoperatively and at 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, 18-month, 2-year, and 3-year follow-ups. Univariate comparisons were conducted using chi-square tests for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables, with analyses performed using Stata 18.0 MP (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).
### RESULTS
Between the two groups, there were no significant differences in cervical reoperation rates (10.9% vs 11.1%, p=0.962), subsidence (23.3% vs 28.3%, p=0.439), or adjacent segment disease (6.9% vs 3.7%, p=0.387). However, patients with BMI ≥35 had a significantly higher rate of in-hospital complications (2.0% vs 7.8%, p=0.032), including swelling, tachycardia, clonus, and other PACU irregularities. Sagittal alignment parameters remained stable between groups at immediate and final follow-ups. Both groups showed improvement in VAS scores postoperatively, though there was a significant difference in 1-year arm VAS (2.52 ± 2.99 vs 7.36 ± 1.83, p=0.030). Additionally, significant differences were found in the 6-month EuroQol index (0.68 ± 0.10 vs 0.55 ± 0.06, p=0.001), 6-month Global Physical Health (GPH) index (44.09 ± 8.87 vs. 33.94 ± 4.12, p=0.001), 6-month Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (25.11 ± 23.00 vs. 48.56 ± 20.92, p=0.042), and multiple follow-ups for the Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) scale.
### CONCLUSIONS
BMI does not appear to significantly affect long-term stability or reoperation rates following ACDF. However, patients with BMI ≥35 had higher in-hospital complication rates and reported less postoperative pain relief and physical health improvements.
