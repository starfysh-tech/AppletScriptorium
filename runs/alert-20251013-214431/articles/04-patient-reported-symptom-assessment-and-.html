<meta name="DC.Description" content="Background Early chemotherapy (CTX) discontinuation in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients can compromise treatment effectiveness and worsen outcomes. Clinical trials show that monitoring and addressing patient-reported symptoms may reduce early discontinuation and improve outcomes. However, evidence from routine care settings where patients are treated in standard clinical practice, especially on the dose-response relationship between number of completed assessments and risk of discontinuation, remains limited.

Methods This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with GI cancers who received CTX at Mass General Brigham between 01/2019 and 01/2024. The Patient-Reported Outcome version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events assessed 12 CTX-related symptoms at CTX initiation and at days 30, 60, and 90. All patients completed baseline assessment. The primary outcome was early discontinuation due to toxicity within 90 days of initiation. Using the Fine-Gray model to account for competing risks of death and progression, we examined the association between early discontinuation and number of completed assessments over time. We also tested whether this association differed across prognostic groups. To address time-varying bias from disease severity, treatment, and prior completion, we applied inverse probability weighting.

Results Among 1,178 patients, the most common cancers were colorectal (35%) and pancreatic (31%), and 45% had stage IV disease. Overall, 784 (67%) completed symptom assessments at CTX initiation and during follow-up. After adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates and time-varying bias, completing post-initiation assessments was associated with a lower cumulative risk of early discontinuation (SHR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.44–1.12]). Results were generally consistent across prognostic groups.

Conclusion More frequent completion of patient-reported symptom assessment post CTX initiation was associated with a lower risk of early discontinuation in practice.

<meta name="og-description" property="og:description" content="Background Early chemotherapy (CTX) discontinuation in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer patients can compromise treatment effectiveness and worsen outcomes. Clinical trials show that monitoring and addressing patient-reported symptoms may reduce early discontinuation and improve outcomes. However, evidence from routine care settings where patients are treated in standard clinical practice, especially on the dose-response relationship between number of completed assessments and risk of discontinuation, remains limited.

Methods This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with GI cancers who received CTX at Mass General Brigham between 01/2019 and 01/2024. The Patient-Reported Outcome version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events assessed 12 CTX-related symptoms at CTX initiation and at days 30, 60, and 90. All patients completed baseline assessment. The primary outcome was early discontinuation due to toxicity within 90 days of initiation. Using the Fine-Gray model to account for competing risks of death and progression, we examined the association between early discontinuation and number of completed assessments over time. We also tested whether this association differed across prognostic groups. To address time-varying bias from disease severity, treatment, and prior completion, we applied inverse probability weighting.

Results Among 1,178 patients, the most common cancers were colorectal (35%) and pancreatic (31%), and 45% had stage IV disease. Overall, 784 (67%) completed symptom assessments at CTX initiation and during follow-up. After adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates and time-varying bias, completing post-initiation assessments was associated with a lower cumulative risk of early discontinuation (SHR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.44–1.12]). Results were generally consistent across prognostic groups.

Conclusion More frequent completion of patient-reported symptom assessment post CTX initiation was associated with a lower risk of early discontinuation in practice.

Clinical trials show that monitoring and addressing patient-reported symptoms may reduce early discontinuation and improve outcomes. However, evidence from routine care settings where patients are treated in standard clinical practice, especially on the dose-response relationship between number of completed assessments and risk of discontinuation, remains limited.</p></div><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><p id="p-4"><strong>Methods</strong> This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with GI cancers who received CTX at Mass General Brigham between 01/2019 and 01/2024. The Patient-Reported Outcome version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events assessed 12 CTX-related symptoms at CTX initiation and at days 30, 60, and 90. All patients completed baseline assessment. The primary outcome was early discontinuation due to toxicity within 90 days of initiation. Using the Fine-Gray model to account for competing risks of death and progression, we examined the association between early discontinuation and number of completed assessments over time. We also tested whether this association differed across prognostic groups. To address time-varying bias from disease severity, treatment, and prior completion, we applied inverse probability weighting.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><p id="p-5"><strong>Results</strong> Among 1,178 patients, the most common cancers were colorectal (35%) and pancreatic (31%), and 45% had stage IV disease. Overall, 784 (67%) completed symptom assessments at CTX initiation and during follow-up. After adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates and time-varying bias, completing post-initiation assessments was associated with a lower cumulative risk of early discontinuation (SHR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.44–1.12]). Results were generally consistent across prognostic groups.</p></div><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><p id="p-6"><strong>Conclusion</strong> More frequent completion of patient-reported symptom assessment post CTX initiation was associated with a lower risk of early discontinuation in practice.</p></div></div><h3>Competing Interest Statement</h3><p id="p-7">The authors have declared no competing interest.</p><h3>Funding Statement</h3><p id="p-8">No funding resource related to this study.</p><h3>Author Declarations</h3><p id="p-9">I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.</p><p id="p-10">Yes</p><p id="p-11">The details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:</p><p id="p-12">This study was approved by the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol number: 25-048).</p><p id="p-13">I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.</p><p id="p-14">Yes</p><p id="p-15">I understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
