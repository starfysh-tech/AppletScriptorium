      "text": "Despite challenges posed by increasingly \"less sick\" populations in ATTR-CM trials and a shift towards favorable FDA approval based on PRO and HR-QoL, CV outcome trials will remain costly. Favoring composite endpoints or win ratio approaches that include functional endpoints like 6-minute walk distance and patient-reported outcome measures can provide valuable insights into disease progression and treatment effects in ATTR-CM."
