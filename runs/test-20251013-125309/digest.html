  <h2><a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.2025.21.10_suppl.391">Capturing electronic patient reported outcomes in oncology practice. - ASCO Publications</a></h2>
  
  <ul>
<li>The study highlights the importance of capturing electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) in oncology practice to enhance patient-centered care and improve treatment decisions.</li>
<li>Implementing ePRO systems can lead to better monitoring of patients&#x27; symptoms and quality of life during cancer treatment, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments to therapy.</li>
<li>Integration of ePRO into standard clinical workflows requires robust data management and analysis capabilities to ensure that the insights gained are actionable and directly inform patient care.</li>

  <ul>
<li>PROs can provide a more holistic evaluation of how treatments impact patients as individuals, helping improve shared decision-making, treatment escalation, and assessment of treatment response in older adults with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).</li>
<li>The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Euro-Qol 5 dimension-5 levels (EQ-5D-5 L) were predictors of all-cause mortality independent of biomarkers in ATTR-CM, demonstrating the importance of PROs alongside traditional clinical outcomes.</li>
<li>Despite challenges posed by increasingly &quot;less sick&quot; populations in ATTR-CM trials and a shift towards favorable FDA approval based on PRO and HR-QoL, CV outcome trials will remain costly. Favoring composite endpoints or win ratio approaches that include functional endpoints like 6-minute walk distance and patient-reported outcome measures can provide valuable insights into disease progression and treatment effects in ATTR-CM.</li>

  <h2><a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OA-25-00051">Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Individuals With Hereditary or Sporadic Kidney Cancer</a></h2>
  
  <ul>
<li>The study emphasizes the importance of patient-reported outcome measures in understanding the impact of hereditary and sporadic kidney cancer on individuals&#x27; quality of life.</li>
<li>It highlights the need for comprehensive care that integrates clinical outcomes with patients&#x27; subjective experiences and perspectives.</li>
<li>The collaborative effort of a multidisciplinary team, including experts in VHL syndrome (Von Hippel-Lindau), underscores the complexity of managing these cancers and the value of coordinated patient care.</li>
