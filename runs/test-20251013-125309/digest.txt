Capturing electronic patient reported outcomes in oncology practice. - ASCO Publications
  https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OP.2025.21.10_suppl.391
    - The study highlights the importance of capturing electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) in oncology practice to enhance patient-centered care and improve treatment decisions.
    - Implementing ePRO systems can lead to better monitoring of patients' symptoms and quality of life during cancer treatment, allowing for timely interventions and adjustments to therapy.
    - Integration of ePRO into standard clinical workflows requires robust data management and analysis capabilities to ensure that the insights gained are actionable and directly inform patient care.

Patient-Reported Outcomes in Older Adults With Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy - JACC

    - PROs can provide a more holistic evaluation of how treatments impact patients as individuals, helping improve shared decision-making, treatment escalation, and assessment of treatment response in older adults with transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).
    - The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) and Euro-Qol 5 dimension-5 levels (EQ-5D-5 L) were predictors of all-cause mortality independent of biomarkers in ATTR-CM, demonstrating the importance of PROs alongside traditional clinical outcomes.
    - Despite challenges posed by increasingly "less sick" populations in ATTR-CM trials and a shift towards favorable FDA approval based on PRO and HR-QoL, CV outcome trials will remain costly. Favoring composite endpoints or win ratio approaches that include functional endpoints like 6-minute walk distance and patient-reported outcome measures can provide valuable insights into disease progression and treatment effects in ATTR-CM.

Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Individuals With Hereditary or Sporadic Kidney Cancer
  https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/OA-25-00051
    - The study emphasizes the importance of patient-reported outcome measures in understanding the impact of hereditary and sporadic kidney cancer on individuals' quality of life.
    - It highlights the need for comprehensive care that integrates clinical outcomes with patients' subjective experiences and perspectives.
    - The collaborative effort of a multidisciplinary team, including experts in VHL syndrome (Von Hippel-Lindau), underscores the complexity of managing these cancers and the value of coordinated patient care.
