      "text": "\"A study conducted at Allegheny Health Network Cancer Institute found that implementing electronic patient reported outcomes (ePRO) in oncology practice led to a 30% increase in patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans. TACTICAL APPLICATION: Oncology practices should adopt ePRO systems to enhance patient engagement, potentially improving treatment adherence by leveraging digital platforms for real-time data collection and communication with patients.\""

      "text": "\"The implementation of an ePRO system resulted in a 25% reduction in hospital readmissions among oncology patients within six months of its introduction. TACTICAL APPLICATION: Healthcare providers should integrate ePRO tools into their workflow to monitor patient health post-treatment, enabling timely interventions that could prevent complications and reduce the need for re-hospitalization.\""

      "text": "\"In a pilot program, patients using an ePRO platform reported a 40% improvement in symptom management and quality of life indicators compared to those not using the system. MARKET/BUSINESS CONTEXT: The adoption of advanced digital health solutions like ePRO is becoming essential for competitive positioning in oncology care, offering tangible benefits such as improved patient outcomes and operational efficiency that can be leveraged by healthcare institutions to differentiate themselves in a rapidly evolving market.\""
