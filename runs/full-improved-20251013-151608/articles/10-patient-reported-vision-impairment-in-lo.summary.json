      "text": "The study identified a relationship between VILL scores and visual function parameters available from both eyes in participants with AMD. Specifically, linear regression models showed significant associations between VILL subscale measures (reading and accessing information, mobility and safety, emotional well-being) and visual acuity metrics like BCVA [logMAR], LLVA [logMAR], MA [logMAR], and PR-CS [logCS]. This indicates that patient-reported quality of life in low luminance situations correlates with objective visual function assessments, potentially guiding interventions or treatments aimed at improving both subjective and functional aspects of vision in AMD patients."

      "text": "The findings suggest that the VILL questionnaire is a reliable and valid tool for assessing vision-related quality of life specifically in contexts relevant to intermediate AMD. Its use could facilitate the development of clinical trials focused on novel interventional strategies targeting low-luminance visual difficulties, thereby potentially improving patient outcomes by directly addressing the specific challenges faced by individuals with AMD in daily activities requiring adaptation to dim lighting conditions.\""
