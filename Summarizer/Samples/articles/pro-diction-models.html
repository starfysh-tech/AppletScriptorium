      <h1>From Prediction to PRO-Diction Models: Incorporating Patient-Reported Outcomes Into Predictive Analytics</h1>
      <p class="byline">By Jane Doe | September 20, 2025</p>
      <p>Machine-learning risk models can only reflect the clinical data they are fed. Without patient-reported outcome measures, the algorithms miss symptom severity, quality-of-life trends, and the day-to-day function data that oncologists rely on when tailoring care.</p>
      <p>Electronic capture of validated questionnaires and integration with the electronic health record now enables real-time alerts. Programs like PRO-CTCAE and PROMIS provide structured inputs that help teams anticipate toxicities and intervene before symptoms escalate.</p>
      <h2>Implementation Checklist</h2>
      <p>Teams rolling out patient-reported outcome platforms highlighted several practical steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start with a narrow cohort to confirm workflows and clinical champions.</li>
        <li>Automate outreach reminders so surveys arrive when patients expect them.</li>
        <li>Feed summaries back to clinicians inside their native EHR in-basket.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Organizations also cautioned against assuming every instrument maps neatly to existing analytics pipelines. Harmonizing terminology across legacy risk models remains an active project.</p>
