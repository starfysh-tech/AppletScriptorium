  <ul>
    <li>KEY FINDING: Patient reported outcomes make oncology ML risk models more precise by adding symptom quality of life, and function data for individualized care.</li>
    <li>TACTICAL WIN: Electronic PRO collection and EHR integration enable real-time physician alerts and dynamic models that anticipate toxicity and support proactive symptom management.</li>
    <li>MARKET SIGNAL: Growing trial and regulatory use of validated PRO instruments signals rising demand for predictive platforms fusing patient experience with clinical and molecular datasets.</li>
    <li>CONCERN: Fragmented PRO measurement standards and limited overlap with existing ML tools hinder implementation, risking inconsistent mortality predictions and inequitable deployment across health systems.</li>
