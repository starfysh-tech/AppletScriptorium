# AppletScriptorium — macOS Automation Tools

AppletScriptorium is a collection of practical automation tools that solve real workflow problems on macOS. Each tool is built with simplicity, local execution, and user control in mind.

## Strategy & Goals

**Philosophy:** Build simple, focused tools that automate tedious tasks without complexity or vendor lock-in.

**Core principles:**
- **Local-first** - Everything runs on your Mac, no cloud dependencies
- **Simple over clever** - Straightforward solutions that work reliably
- **User control** - You choose when and how tools run
- **No magic** - Plain scripts you can read, modify, and understand

**What belongs here:**
- Tools that save significant time on repetitive tasks
- Automation that enhances existing workflows (email, git, browser)
- Scripts that integrate local services (LLMs, Mail.app, Chrome)

**What doesn't:**
- Complex frameworks requiring extensive configuration
- Cloud-dependent services
- Tools duplicating existing solutions without clear advantage

## Tools

### ExtensionAuditor (🟢 5 minutes)
Chrome extension security scanner. Analyzes installed extensions and generates CRXplorer-compatible reports.

**Use case:** Audit browser extensions for security risks, outdated versions, and malicious code.

**Get started:** Zero dependencies - just run it:
```bash
python3 ExtensionAuditor/extension-auditor.py
```
[Full documentation →](./ExtensionAuditor/)

---

### SegmentSalmon (🟢 5 minutes)
M3U8/HLS video stream downloader. Downloads video segments in parallel with lossless quality preservation.

**Use case:** Download streaming videos from M3U8 playlists (HLS streams) with concurrent downloads and smart retry logic.

**Get started:** Automatic dependency management - just run it:
```bash
SegmentSalmon/segment-salmon 'https://example.com/playlist.m3u8'
```
[Full documentation →](./SegmentSalmon/)

---

### SwiftHAL (🟢 5 minutes)
Swift CLI tool for Halstead complexity metrics. Analyzes code complexity with visual TUI and architecture insights.

**Use case:** Track code complexity, prioritize refactoring, identify hotspots, enforce quality gates in CI/CD.

**Get started:** Build from source or download binary release:
```bash
cd SwiftHAL && swift build -c release
cp .build/release/SwiftHAL /usr/local/bin/hal
hal --path Sources
```

---

### CommitCraft (🟡 10 minutes)
Development workflow enhancement toolkit. Automated git commits and releases with AI assistance.

**Use case:** Automate commits and releases with security checks, conventional format, and auto-generated release notes.

**Get started:** One-time global install, works in all repositories:
```bash

Future tools will live alongside existing tools. Shared utilities will migrate to `shared/` when needed.

## Testing

Each tool includes tests or validation:

```bash
# Summarizer - Full test suite
python3 -m pytest Summarizer/tests

# ExtensionAuditor - Dry run validation
python3 ExtensionAuditor/extension-auditor.py --help

# SegmentSalmon - Help and validation
SegmentSalmon/segment-salmon --help

# CommitCraft - Test analysis script
~/.claude/scripts/commitcraft-analyze.sh
```

## Development

**AI Assistant Guides:**
- **Claude Code**: [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) - Development commands, code style, module patterns
- **Other AI**: [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) - Build commands, project conventions

**Configuration:**
- Create `.env` from [.env.template](./.env.template)
- Tool-specific configs in `Tool/config.py` or `Tool/README.md`

**Key Conventions:**
- Python module invocation: `python3 -m Tool.cli` (not direct script paths)
- System Python required (Summarizer Mail rules)
- Snake_case for functions/variables
- Conventional Commits for git messages

---

## Contributing New Tools

New tools should follow these guidelines:

1. **Solve a real problem** - Automate something genuinely tedious
2. **Keep it simple** - Straightforward implementation over clever abstraction
3. **Work locally** - Prefer local execution, avoid cloud dependencies
4. **Document clearly** - README with usage examples and troubleshooting
5. **Test thoroughly** - Include test suite or validation script

**Directory structure:**
```
ToolName/
├── main-script.py           # Primary script
├── config.py                # Configuration (if needed)
├── README.md                # Usage documentation
├── requirements.txt         # Dependencies (if Python)
└── tests/                   # Test suite
```

**Before contributing:**
- Check existing tools don't already solve this
- Verify it runs reliably on macOS
- Include setup/installation instructions
- Add troubleshooting section

See individual tool READMEs for examples.

## Philosophy

These tools embody Larry Wall's three great virtues of a programmer:

### Laziness
**"The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure."**

Automate tedious tasks so you never do them manually again:
- **Summarizer:** Never read 20 articles when AI can distill the key insights for you
- **ExtensionAuditor:** Security audit in one command, not hours of manual clicking and research
- **CommitCraft:** Beautiful commit messages and releases without thinking about format or versioning

### Impatience
**"The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy."**

Get results immediately, no complex setup or waiting:
- **ExtensionAuditor:** Zero configuration, instant CSV output
- **CommitCraft:** One install command, works in every repository forever
- **Summarizer:** Configure once, then automated intelligence digests arrive like clockwork

### Hubris
**"The quality that makes you write programs that other people won't want to say bad things about."**

Build tools good enough that others want to use them:
- **Local-first:** No cloud dependencies or vendor lock-in
- **Transparent:** Plain scripts anyone can read, modify, and understand
- **Respectful:** Documentation that values your time, minimal configuration, clear error messages

> "We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris."
> — Larry Wall, *Programming Perl* (1991)
